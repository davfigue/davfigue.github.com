    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, after listening to a friend about all the bell and whistles
related to blogging with <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> I decided to
test it by myself. The
philosophy is simple but powerful. Octopress is based on
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, as said in the project's page <em>"a
simple, blog
aware site generator"</em>, the main idea is to create your web site
locally using a whole pipeline of tools like Textile, Markdown and
others that are integrated into it (I'm not specially an expert about
it) and spit out a complete
static set of files that you can serve very easily with whatever
webserver at your hands. Apart from minimizing the whole processing
bunch needed to serve dynamic web sites (CMS, MVC frameworks, caching
...) it is also very productive. The only thing that you need to write
your stuff is a text editor (like Vim xD) and let the magic
happen. Of course if you have a well configured text editor, you'll have
a nice set of tools for editing your posts in whatever <strong>text-to-html</strong>
conversion tool. Without noticing, now I have the subject for the next
post, <em>How to configure <strong>Vim</strong> for efective editing and programming in
the
modern times!</em>.</p>

<p>Well that's all for today folks!</p>
